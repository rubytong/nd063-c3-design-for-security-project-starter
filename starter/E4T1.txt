# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Remove the rule which allows access to port 22 from internet in the security group attached to web app instance
- Allow only access to port 22 from trusted √çP in the security group attached to web app instance
- Use Session Manager service to access to web app instance instead of SSH keys
- Use WAF with corresponding rule

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Block public access to secret recipes bucket
- Use VPC endpoint to make secure/private connection between web app instance and secret receipt s3 bucket
- Add bucket policy to only allow access from specific roles/principals/resources
